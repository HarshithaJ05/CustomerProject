Project Name: Customer Management System

Description:
The Customer Management System is a web application built to effectively manage customer information. It offers CRUD operations, search functionality, synchronization
with a remote API, user authentication, and pagination. The system is developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, HTML, and CSS technologies.The project aims to provide a comprehensive 
solution for storing, retrieving, and manipulating customer data efficiently.

Key Features:
.User Authentication: Users must log in using their credentials before accessing the system. This ensures that only authorized users can interact with the customer data.
.CRUD Operations: The system allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete customer records, enabling efficient management of customer information.
.Search Functionality: Users can search for specific customer records by parameters such as first name, city, email, or phone number, enhancing accessibility to relevant data.
.Sync with Remote API: The system synchronizes with a remote API to fetch the latest customer list. Any new or updated records from the API are then integrated into the local database.
.Token-Based Authentication: After successful login by the admin, a token is generated. This token is used for subsequent API calls, providing authentication and authorization for accessing protected resources.
.Pagination: Pagination is implemented to improve usability, dividing large datasets into smaller pages for easier navigation.

Project Structure:
.Backend: Implemented using Java Servlets for handling HTTP requests, business logic, database operations, and API integrations.
.Frontend: Developed using JSP (JavaServer Pages), HTML, and CSS for dynamic content generation and user interface design.
.Database: Utilizes MySQL for storing customer data, with appropriate tables and relationships defined to manage information efficiently.

Dependencies:
.JSON Library: Used for parsing JSON data received from the remote API and handling JSON-related operations.
.MySQL: Utilized for database management, storage, and retrieval of customer records.

Note:
Login Requirement: Users must log in with the correct username and password before accessing the system. This ensures that only authorized users can interact with sensitive customer data.
